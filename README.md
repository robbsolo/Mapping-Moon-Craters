# Mapping-Moon-Craters
Converting coordinates of lunar craters from spherical to cartesian coordinates using publicly available data and Blender - to place spheres, representing craters and normalized to the largest one, on the surface of a larger sphere, representing the moon.
I got the crater list from: https://planet4589.org/astro/lunar/index.html, Jonathan McDowell, 2004 Mar 8.
